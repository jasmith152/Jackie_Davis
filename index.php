"Citrus County is one of the least expensive counties in Florida for combined costs of housing, food, apparel, transportation, health, recreation and personal services."<br /><br />

<strong>History of Citrus County, Florida</strong><br /><br />

Few counties in Florida enjoy a more salubrious year-round climate then Citrus. Summer days average 82 degrees, moderated by constant breezes from the lakes and the Gulf of Mexico; while winter lows average 62 degrees, encouraging the dedicated gardener to experiment with a wide variety of flowers and vegetables every month of the year. Rainfall averages 45 to 52 inches, most falling during the summer months.<br /><br />

<strong>Culture And Community Growth From An Ancient Heritage</strong><br /><br />

Rich in natural wonders, Citrus County also boasts an ancient and rich heritage. Here the woods and fields are littered with the relics and memories of mankind's pilgrimage through history. Millenia before Miami was invented or Lake Okeechobee diked, men and woman farmed the land, harvested the bounty from the sea, and created community in Citrus County. According to archaeologists, the earliest settlers speared mammoth and challenged the saber-toothed tiger on this land more than 10,000 years ago. In more recent past, about 500 BC, a community was established along the banks of the Crystal River through three cultural epochs until 1400 AD. The state-managed Crystal River Archaeological Site, one mile west of U.S. 19 on the north side of Crystal River, with its burial mounds and riverside temple pyramid, tell the story.<br /><br />

More than a century before the first pilgrim put a boot on Plymouth Rock, Spanish explorers, including Hernando DeSoto, were trading beads and rumors of gold with the Indians in villages throughout the region which is now Citrus County. In the early 1830's, the first group of northern entrepreneurs, including New York born David Yulee who settled on the Homosassa River, arrived in coastal Citrus County to develop huge sugar plantations and to plant the first citrus groves. Yulee is also credited with building the first railroad south of Cedar Key.<br /><br />

Modern Citrus County is a mosaic of towns and villages in 682 square miles. Several such as Crystal River and Homosassa Springs, trace their roots to the early 19th century American frontier which depended on water for communication, trade and transportation. The architecture of the homes and businesses in Inverness, much of it wonderfully restored, suggests the optimism Floridians felt at the turn of the century.<br /><br />

Located in West Central Florida, Citrus County is an ideal place to call home with its numerous recreational opportunities, its natural resources, and its mild subtropical climate. The county is surrounded by water bounded on the north and east by the Withlacoochee river, on the east is the Tsala Apopka chain of lakes, and on the west is the Gulf of Mexico, into which the Homosassa and Crystal Rivers flow. The west coast is noted for hundreds of creeks, islands, inlets, bays, and natural springs. The waters are plentiful with black bass, speckled perch, blue gill, shellcracker, grouper, spotted seatrout, catfish and others. Tarpon are in from April to October.<br /><br />

The county is well known for its manatee population, and for those who do not know, the best time to see them is in January in Kings Bay or one or the other seven rivers our gulf coast offers. Golfing, canoeing, nature studies, hiking, scuba diving, fishing, and swimming are just a few of the activities enjoyed by its residents and visitors.<br /><br />

Our roadways provide excellent intercounty movement putting us in close proximity to Interstate 75, the Florida Turnpike, and the major population centers of North and Central Florida. Tampa and Orlando International Airports can be reached in 90 minutes.<br /><br />

The Citrus County Parks and Recreation Division maintains 22 county boat ramps, 23 county parks, one campground, three community centers and the Citrus County Auditorium. We have an 1150 seat auditorium where we hear the Central Florida Symphony in addition to a varied menu of cultural performances.<br /><br />

Many are attracted to the county's natural resources; more than one-third of the county is protected as state, federal, and county park land, or fish and wildlife reserves.
