    <td><p>This vast community has a population of about 5,500 people with home sites that start with one acre on up to 6 acres.  There are sections of Pine Ridge where one acre lots are sitting on the horse trail and the homeowner is allowed to have a horse.  Many of the larger parcels have stables.<br /><br />
The Pine Ridge Equestrian Center was built for those who don’t have pastures and they offer corrals and a stable for 17 horses with a trail and jump area for the rider wishing to practice his skills.

    <td><p>A short drive to the west from Citrus Hills gets you to the exquisite Golf of Mexico. Take a chartered boat tour or a fishing trip into the warm Gulf waters.  No big crowds here, just pure breathtaking views. Sometimes it’s just you and the manatees.  For a fresh water fishing experience take a short ride to the east and you’ll have a choice of 3 lake chains.  It’s hard to top this for an easy day of excitement, in either direction.
