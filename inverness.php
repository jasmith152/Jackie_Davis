Settled around 1968, Inverness is the county seat of Citrus County with a population of over 7,000.  A Scotsman was inspired to name the town Inverness because Tsala Apopka Lake reminded him of the highlands and lochs of Inverness, Scotland.  Many of the city’s streets have Scottish names and an exchange program at one time between the two cities inspired visits from each side of the ocean to the other.<br /><br />
In 1961, Elvis Presley was filmed in the area during the making of the movie, “Follow That Dream”, where the production crew used the now historic Inverness courthouse for a courthouse scene.  Recently Inverness hosted the “Elvis in Florida” 3-day festival.

    <td><p>This same courthouse is prized for its unique design: built as a square, all four sides are exactly alike and can each be a main entrance.  Back in the early 1990’s the courthouse was closed for several years during which, using grant funds, it was lovingly restored.  Today it houses a Historical Museum along with the Citrus County Historical Society and is the setting for many functions, concerts, art displays and lectures.<br /><br />
The Arbor Foundation and the US Forestry Service has named Inverness “Tree City USA”, a designation given to communities that meet standards of sound urban forestry management.  Despite being a sizable, incorporated city, Inverness offers nature lovers the opportunity to commune with the native flora and fauna.  Many of the downtown Inverness neighborhoods have streets lined with a canopy of ancient oaks.

    <td><p>More recently Inverness has become known as a cyclist’s delight.  We are blessed with 46 miles of bike trails on the Withlacoochee Rails-To-Trails, sitting but a few blocks away from downtown Inverness.  A 400 member citizen support organization restored a 1925 caboose that is used as the Inverness trail-head.  This well used and popular bike path takes riders as far north as Dunnellon and as far south as Owenboro Junction.  While walking or biking you’ll spot wild turkeys, wading birds and enough other fowl to make it a bird watcher’s paradise.
