    <td><p>Inverness is now known as a "bike friendly" city by providing easy access to The Withlacoochee Trail State Park, the largest bike park in the area.  With 46 miles of paved tail that runs along the course of the Withlacoochee River, it’s built on an abandoned and reclaimed railroad track and runs across several counties.  The Trail is the largest paved trail in the state of Florida.  An unpaved horse trail runs along portions of the 46 miles, should you wish to ride your horse through one of the most beautiful scenic areas of Florida.  You’ll ride near small towns and ranches to take in the sights and sounds of rural, natural and beautiful Florida.  It’s mostly flat trail riding, so you need not worry about climbing steep terrain.</p></td>
