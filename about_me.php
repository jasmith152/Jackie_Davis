    <td><p>Arriving from New York 22 years ago, I immediately knew that this laidback lifestyle was southern living at its best. My late husband, Bob, enticed me into joining him as a Realtor 20 years ago and I've been grateful ever since. While in New York I owned an executive search franchise, not realizing how beneficial my interviewing skills would become as a Realtor. Bob and I, as a team, had used a tag line: "Stress-free transactions". Negotiating an offer, helping the offer to become a contract and then keeping the transaction together right up to the closing table - that's the marvel of real estate. What a joy it's been.<br /><br />
We shamelessly entice you to Citrus County with our good school system, safe environment, user friendly roads and broadband capabilities. With our clear skies and abundantly sunny days, Citrus County encourages you to engage in green energy efforts and earth-friendly xeroscape programs.<br /><br />
Our charming towns of Inverness, Hernando, Floral City and Crystal River beckon to you. Whether the home sits on the Gulf of Mexico, on one of our three lake chains or on one of our seven rivers, nature is never far away. Our architecture allows you to bring nature right into your home.<br /><br />
Citrus County real estate is ripe for the picking. Try us. You'll like us.</p>
