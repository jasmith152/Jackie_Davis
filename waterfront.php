    <td><p>Just over 5 miles long the spring fed Rainbow River merges with the Withlacoochee River and boast a state park, whose entrance is in nearby Dunnellon.  The springs are the 4th largest in Florida and have a constant water temperature of 72 degrees. People have been enjoying these springs for 10,000 years! You can lie under one of the parks majestic oaks and magnolias as you gaze over the river and famous phosphate pits that are part of the nature trail.<br /><br />
Of waterfront property, Kings Bay in Crystal River is a stand out.  It is a refuge for the endangered manatee, a local tourist draw for which a local festival is named.  There are about 30 springs in the Kings Bay area.  Dive shops and marinas cater to scuba divers and boaters.  Bring your fishing rod to reel in a trout or largemouth bass.  This is the part of Florida that Jimmy Buffett sings about.</p>

    <td><p>Pritchard Island on the east side of Citrus County was once a place you could find only hickory, live oak and water oak trees.  It’s now an area of waterfront homes with a community center and a nature trail.  Cypress trees were planted to preserve the natural beauty of the waterfront.  It’s a sublimely quiet waterfront area that’s near Inverness, the county seat.<br /><br />
Nearby Gospel Island offers similar amenities and was named after a group of ministers who intended to build retirement homes there.  Here residents enjoy all the water activities you can find anywhere else in Florida, without the hassle of traffic or the hustle and bustle of big city living.</p>
