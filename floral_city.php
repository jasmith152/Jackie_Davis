The small town of Floral City has approximately 5,000 people and is located 10 minutes south of the county seat of Inverness which is Citrus County’s biggest town.<br /><br />
Begun in 1883, Floral City was once larger than Miami due to the discovery of phosphate before World War II.  About a dozen mines dotted Floral City before the war and workers came from as far away as Georgia and South Carolina.  The population back then was about 10,000 people.  It was a vibrant and exciting time for Floral City as various institutions were built to support the growing population.  Floral City's boom came to an end around the end of World War I, when the demand for phosphate fell in the European markets.</p>

    <td><p>Large homes occupy the famous tree-lined Orange Avenue. The majestic oaks form a canopy over the avenue and each tree is designated an historic landmark and is cherished.  These homes were part of the boom period and housed the upper crust of Floral City.  Today they are seen on tours when our historic homes are open to the public.</p>

    <td><p>Orange Avenue continues on east as SR48 and will ultimately take you to I-75. Many of Floral City's homes sit on the Floral City Lake Chain with a canal that take you into the Withlacoochee River.  Duval Island has charming waterfront homes, the large and popular Ferris Groves (oranges and strawberries) and a gated waterfront community at its end.  At the start of Duval Island is a public boat ramp, one of many throughout our waterways that make boating easy and accessible.
